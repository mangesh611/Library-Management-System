# Library-Management-System
A Library Management System (LMS) is a software solution designed to manage and automate library operations such as book management, member registration, and book transactions. This system ensures efficient handling of books and borrowers while reducing manual effort.

In this project, Java (JDBC) is used for backend development, and MySQL serves as the database. The system allows users to add books, register members, issue books, return books, and view transactions. It utilizes HashMap, HashSet, TreeSet, and TreeMap for efficient data storage and retrieval.

The database consists of three main tables:

Books Table - Stores book details with unique book IDs.
Members Table - Maintains registered members.
Transactions Table - Tracks book issuance and returns, linking books and members.
